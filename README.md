# PyROA

PyROA is a tool for modelling quasar lightcurves where the variability is described using a running optimal average (ROA), and paramters are sampled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques - specifically using emcee.
Currently it has three main uses:

1. Determining the time delay between lightcurves at different wavelengths. 
2. Intercalibrating lightcurves from multiple telescopes, merging them into a single lightcurve
3. Determining the time delay between images of lensed quasars, where the microlensing effects are also modelled.
